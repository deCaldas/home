## Personal Note

This project was originally cloned from Takuya Matsuyama’s website as a learning exercise. At the time, I was just starting my journey with web development.

Through this clone, I learned practical Git, GitHub Pages, Next.js, Chakra UI, React, and more — including valuable lessons about structure, modularity, and design. Over time, I’ve customized it with my portfolio, projects, and personal branding.

This homepage is part of my growth story. I honor its origin and continue building my own path from here.
